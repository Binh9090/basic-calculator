# Basic Calculator Program

This is a simple calculator program in Python that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can select an operation and input two numbers to get the result. The program also handles division errors by checking for division by zero.

## Features
- Supports four basic operations: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- Includes error handling for division by zero.
- Interactive prompts to guide users through the calculation process.

## How to Use
1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. Enter one of the following operations when prompted:
   - `+` for addition
   - `-` for subtraction
   - `*` for multiplication
   - `/` for division
3. Input two numbers when prompted:
   - `Số thứ nhất` (First number)
   - `Số thứ hai` (Second number)
4. The program will display the result or show an error if dividing by zero.

### Example
```
Các phép toán: +, -, *, /
Bạn muốn làm phép tính nào? +
Số thứ nhất: 3
Số thứ hai: 5
Kết quả: 8
```

## Limitations
- Only supports basic operations (no exponentiation, modulus, etc.).
- Does not allow multi-step calculations (e.g., chaining operations).
- Requires user inputs as numbers and valid operations to function correctly.
